title: Creating a 3D Case Design

Today, Catherine created a rough prototype of the 3D case which houses the ESP32, breadboard, MQ-135, BME680, and jumper wires. The case contains two air inlets on each side to allow air to pass through for sensor detection. The case was made with Fusion360.

## Next Steps

We plan to add additional features to the case including a battery compartment at the bottom of the case and a hole for the micro-usb to plug in directly the the ESP32 (for the prototype version). Multiple versions of the case will be created for the prototype version and the production version. The cases will be 3D printed using the Prusa 3D printers at our school.
