Today, we wrote a brief write up summary paper of our project to be shared with professors and generate interest about our project. The paper includes a statement of intent, a purpose statement, technical details, diagrams, used materials / software, and images.

## Statement of Intent

> As we move into a future where air quality continues to decline, it is important to have a tool for vulnerable groups of people to understand what they are breathing in and what is in the air around them. Although small air quality devices exist, very few portable devices are readily available, making it difficult for those who need this service to access it. We are designing a Portable Air Quality device with tailorability features for the immunocompromised and those living in vulnerable areas.

## Purpose

> Not every air quality device available is built for the needs of individuals. Our device and the corresponding app would personalize the user experience and would be much more efficient and effective than what is currently available. We hope to show people what they canâ€™t see. The complimentary app contains features to notify caretakers of immunocompromised patients and parents of children living in vulnerable areas details about location and air quality measurements. Our aim is to have this device detect as many airborne allergens and pathogens as possible.
